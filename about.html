            <p class="para text-start m-0 mb-3"> One of the most challenging issues faced by college management today is the low attendance rate of students in their classes. Additionally, there has been an increase in the issuance of fake degrees without actual attendance. Among various proposed solutions, implementing a student attendance system using blockchain technology is considered the most effective.</p><br>

            <p class="para text-start">E-attendance system for students with the blockchain methodology can keep the data immutable that cannot
                be
                altered or changed by any means. The system will provide permanent record of lecture attendance that can
                be
                helpful for evaluation purposes. The attendance once marked cannot be updated and data is stored safely
                at
                all connected locations. The record is transparent and accessible through all connected nodes. The
                system
                cannot be controlled centrally or no intermediary party will be required. It is automation with secured
                unidirectional encryption.</p><br>

            <p class="para text-start">The system offers separate interfaces for students, faculty, and management, each tailored for their specific transactions. It operates on the principle of mining blocks with unique IDs and proof of work before adding them to the main database. A hashing technique will be used to verify the digital signatures of students. Students will log into their portals to mark attendance for the classes they are authorized to attend. Meanwhile, management will define attendance options for specific classes where students are enrolled. A user-friendly, web-based interface will be developed for both students and management.</p>
